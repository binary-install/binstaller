## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a Code of Conduct that all contributors are expected to follow. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

Key principles:
- Be respectful and inclusive
- Be collaborative
- Be constructive in feedback
- Focus on what is best for the community

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.18 or higher
- Git
- GitHub account

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository**

   Start by forking the repository on GitHub.

2. **Clone your fork**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/godownloader.git
   cd godownloader
   ```

3. **Add the upstream remote**

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/haya14busa/godownloader.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

5. **Build the project**

   ```bash
   go build ./cmd/godownloader
   ```

6. **Run tests**

   ```bash
   go test ./...
   ```

## Development Workflow

We follow a standard GitHub flow:

1. **Create a branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

   Branch naming conventions:
   - `feature/` for new features
   - `fix/` for bug fixes
   - `docs/` for documentation changes
   - `refactor/` for code refactoring
   - `test/` for adding or updating tests

2. **Make your changes**

   Implement your changes, following the [coding standards](#coding-standards).

3. **Commit your changes**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
   ```

   Commit message guidelines:
   - Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
   - Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
   - Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

4. **Push to your fork**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create a pull request**

   Open a pull request from your fork to the main repository.

6. **Address review feedback**

   Make any requested changes and push them to your branch.

## Pull Request Process

1. **PR Title and Description**

   - Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Include a detailed description of the changes
   - Reference any related issues using GitHub's issue linking syntax (e.g., "Fixes #123")

2. **PR Checklist**

   Ensure your PR meets these requirements:
   - [ ] Code follows the project's coding standards
   - [ ] Tests have been added or updated for the changes
   - [ ] Documentation has been updated if necessary
   - [ ] All tests pass
   - [ ] The code builds without errors or warnings

3. **Review Process**

   - At least one maintainer must approve the PR
   - Address all review comments
   - Maintainers may request changes before merging

4. **Merging**

   Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR. We typically use squash merging to keep the history clean.

## Coding Standards

We follow standard Go coding conventions and best practices:

### Code Style

- Follow the [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
- Use `gofmt` to format your code
- Follow the [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go) guidelines

### Package Structure

```
godownloader/
├── cmd/                  # Command-line applications
│   └── godownloader/     # Main application
├── internal/             # Private application and library code
│   ├── config/           # Configuration handling
│   ├── shell/            # Shell script generation
│   └── attestation/      # Attestation verification
├── pkg/                  # Library code that's ok to use by external applications
│   ├── download/         # Download utilities
│   └── verify/           # Verification utilities
└── docs/                 # Documentation
```

### Error Handling

- Use error wrapping: `fmt.Errorf("failed to do something: %w", err)`
- Return errors rather than panicking
- Provide context in error messages

### Logging

- Use structured logging with appropriate levels
- Log at appropriate levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Include relevant context in log messages

## Testing Guidelines

We strive for high test coverage and quality:

### Test Structure

- Place tests in the same package as the code they test
- Name test files with `_test.go` suffix
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate

### Test Coverage

- Aim for at least 80% test coverage
- Cover both happy paths and error cases
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions

### Example Test

```go
func TestVerifyAttestation(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name           string
        binary         string
        attestation    string
        expectedResult bool
    }{
        {
            name:           "Valid attestation",
            binary:         "testdata/valid-binary",
            attestation:    "testdata/valid-attestation",
            expectedResult: true,
        },
        // More test cases...
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            result := VerifyAttestation(tt.binary, tt.attestation)
            if result != tt.expectedResult {
                t.Errorf("VerifyAttestation() = %v, want %v", result, tt.expectedResult)
            }
        })
    }
}
```
